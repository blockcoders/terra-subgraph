# Terra Subgraph

[Terra](https://www.terra.money/) is a public blockchain protocol deploying a suite of algorithmic decentralized stablecoins.

This subgraph dynamically tracks the current state of Terra contracts (LUNA, UST, wUST and wLUNA), and contains derived stats for things like historical data and USD prices.

## Running Locally

Make sure to update package.json settings to point to your own graph account.

## Queries

Below are a few ways to show how to query the terra-subgraph for data. The queries show most of the information that is queryable, but there are many other filtering options that can be used, just check out the [querying api](https://thegraph.com/docs/graphql-api). These queries can be used locally or in The Graph Explorer playground.
